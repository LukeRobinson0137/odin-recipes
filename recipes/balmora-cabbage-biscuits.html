    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely shred the cabbage.</li>
        <li>Place the shredded cabbage in a strainer over a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle it generously with salt and let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Afterward, squeeze out as much liquid as you can and discard the excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Heat a little oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded cabbage and season with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook until the cabbage softens and begins to brown slightly.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked cabbage to a medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add butter to the warm cabbage and stir until it melts.</li>
        <li>Pour in the milk and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, then sprinkle in the yeast.</li>
        <li>Beat in the egg.</li>
        <li>Gradually mix in flour until a soft, sticky dough forms and pulls away from the bowl.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for several minutes, until it becomes smooth and springs back when poked.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough to about ¾ inch (2 cm) thick.</li>
        <li>Score the tops lightly in a checkered pattern using a sharp knife (for texture and appearance).</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into rounds using a biscuit cutter.</li>
        <li>Place the rounds on a lined or greased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Let the shaped biscuits rise again for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) if you haven’t already.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the biscuits with heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown on top.</li>
