Odin Recipes is a project where I'll put all my current HTML knowledge to practice by building a basic recipe website. 

The website will consist of an index page and I'll be using links to connect to some recipes. 

The following skills is what I've demonstrated in the project:

1. Creating HTML Boilerplate from memory
2. Using image element
3. Linking 3 recipe pages to index.html using the anchor element
4. Understanding the difference between un-ordered list element and ordered list element
5. The importance of having a good file structure
6. Commiting as early and often as possible to get better at writing good commit messages.
7. Showcasing the importance of html structure regarding the use and understanding of headings element
